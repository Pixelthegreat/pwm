# pwm
Pixel's Window Manager. I want to do something different yet again.

# requirements to build
- the Xlib development libraries

# requirements to test/run
- xinit (something to do with x servers idk)
- Xephyr (a nested X server program which allows for an X server to be run inside of a window; used for testing)
- xterm (you can use any example app for the test app, this is just the one that I chose. You can change it by editing xinitrc)

# to build
run make.

# to test run
run "make testrun".
